<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üôã About The Project

 ![Screenshot](demo.gif)






When looking for an online video player for your website, you might hear the names YouTube and Vimeo before any else. That‚Äôs because these are quick, easy, and free options readily available to you. However, if you want more control over your video assets, how they are displayed, and want to learn how users interact with your content and engage with it, you might need a private HTML5 video player.

Flash-based players have become less popular now and HTML5 video players have become the new industry standard. For facilitating seamless integration on your website, this is suggested best online video player for you! :smile:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## üèóÔ∏è Implementation

* First of all, we added an SVG as a hero image because an svg can scale upto any size according as the size of the viewport.
* Then added a video element with attribute `playsinline` which gonna prevent the video to be played in full screen mode by default on mobile views.

<summary>Ui Components:</summary>
<ol>
<li>
    <details>
      <summary>Play Icon, Video, Mobile Responsiveness.</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Making `video` element to take `min-width: 800px` & `max-width: 80vw` and on large smart phone (600px or less), `min-width: 0` & `max-width: 90%`.</li>
        <li>On the click on `play-icon` or on the video, the video starts playing and `play-icon` turn into `pause-icon` & vice-versa. Also, when the current playlist is ended i.e. when `ended` event fires, `pause-icon` turn into `play-icon`.</li>
        <li>Also, on the click at different position on Volume Bar, it'll change current volume. To do that, extract `offsetX` & `offsetWidth` value from Volume Bar element and calculate the percentage of `offsetX` in `offsetWidth`, then update `width` of volume-bar & Change `volume-icon` accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Controls HTML, Show controls on hover</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>By default, `control-container` has `opacity` 0 but when hover over it, it'll get opacity of 1 and added animation of style `ease-out` with delay of 2s.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    </li>
  <li>
    <details>
      <summary>Progress Bar - width-increment, hover-effect</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>A progress-bar consists of two parts: the `progress-range` & the `progress-bar` itself. We used `calc()` CSS function to set width of `progress-range` and added some `animation` on hover as the `thikness` increases!.</li>
        <li> On the fire of `canPlay`, `timeupdate` events, the values of these properties `currentTime`, `duration` extracted from `video` element and calculated percentage of `currentTime` in `duration` & set it as `width` of Progress-Bar. Followed by `time-elapsed`, `total-duration` update.</li>
        <li>Also, on the click at different position on progress bar, it'll change current playback position. To do that, extract `offsetX` & `offsetWidth` value from Progress Bar element and calculate the percentage of `offsetX` in `offsetWidth`along `duration`, then update `width` of progress-bar, `time-elapsed`, `total-duration` etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>
  <details>
      <summary>Playback Speed Dropdown</summary>
    <ul>
        <li>On change of playback speed, the `change` event fires on `select` element and then `playbackRate` property on video element is set to selected value of Playback Speed Dropdown.</li>
      </ul>

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## üíé Features

- [ ] Plays anything: Plays ‚Äútraditional‚Äù file formats such as MP4 and WebM, but also supports adaptive streaming formats such as HLS and DASH. There‚Äôs even a special UI for live streams!
- [ ] Easy to style: Designed to be a reliable and consistent base to build on top of. The player looks great out of the box, but can be easily styled with a little bit of extra CSS.
- [ ] Supported everywhere: Your video should work everywhere your app does. The team makes an effort to support every modern browser we can, including desktop and mobile.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Prasenjit-3433/Custom-Video-Player/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
